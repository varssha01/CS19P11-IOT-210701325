ABSTRACT:
This project showcases an Arduino-based automatic room temperature control system that uses a
temperature sensor to monitor the environment. Next, to provide a comfortable and energy-efficient environment,
the Arduino adjusts the speed of a coupled DC fan motor based on the difference between the temperature that is 
sensed and a user-defined objective. Subsequent versions could look into different microcontrollers for possible 
large-scale manufacturing and integrate smartphone features, enabling companies, households, and individuals 
suffering from conditions like anhidrosis—which prevents them from sensing a room's temperature rise—to utilize 
this technology. It provides a more complete comfort solution than only fan-based temperature control by adding 
humidity control. With the use of specialized sensors, the system continuously checks the temperature and humidity. 
Each parameter has target values that can be defined by the user. After that, the Arduino analyses the data and acts
in response to any deviations. Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) is used to adjust the fan speed in order to maintain
humidity and introduce moisture. A motor is used to trigger the water sprinkler system. Using targeted changes, this
combined strategy promises to potentially reduce energy use while producing a comfortable, cool, and humid environment.
